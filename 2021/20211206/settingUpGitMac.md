Purpose: outline how to set up Git on a Mac.

1. git appears to be installed out of the factory.  Verify this with "git" at the command line.
2. set up public/private keys with ssh-keygen
3. copy the PUBLIC key to github/gitlabs.  This is /home/jbf/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  (Guard id_rsa carefully.  This is the security.)
4. git clone git clone git@github.umn.edu:FADEN004/talk_20210928.git
5. Now start up Autoplot, where we will add the git commands.
6. on Script tab, right-click, Settings->Editor Bookmarks
7. Edit->New Folder...
