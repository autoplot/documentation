Purpose: notes for transitioning to using Netbeans 7.3.

Audience: Developers using Netbeans

= Introduction =
It's time to upgrade to 7.3.  There have been known issues with earlier versions of Netbeans that make upgrading non-trivial.  7.3 still has issues, but this documents them.

= rebase =
* when this product is first imported into NB 7.3, it will make changes to the project files that cause things to break.  These changes should be reverted in VirboAutoplot/nbproject.
