There are a few things that need to be done to add documentation, this documents.

* add javahelp folder to correct project next to source
* add AutoplotHelp project to the dependencies for the project.
* copy over documentation from DataSourcePack/javahelp/
* make appropriate changes.
* make sure Autoplot.org link has proper link, e.g. "http://autoplot.org/help#ascii_main"
* src/META-INF/helpsets.txt
* register the help stuff in the doc system in the java code:
AutoplotHelpSystem.getHelpSystem().registerHelpID(this, "ascii_main");
