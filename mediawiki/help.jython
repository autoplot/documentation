Jython is Python implemented in Java.  With Jython, you can script Java applications like Autoplot, creating new functionality for your particular applications.  Autoplot also provides Jython with an interface to create data objects similar to arrays in IDL and NumPy, but with metadata attached; and also a large set of functions useful for creating science workflows.
