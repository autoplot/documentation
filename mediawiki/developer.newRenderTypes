Adding a new data renderer (spectrogram, line, digital, etc) is possible, and should some day be as easy as adding data sources.  Right now you need to:

# define the das2 renderer in das2.
# search for DigitalRenderer
# Everywhere you find it, add analogous code for new type.
# RenderTypeUtil.needsColorbar
