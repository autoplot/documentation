= Low Memory Warning =
If you are visiting this page, it's Autoplot has detected there is limited ram memory available to the process, and many datasets will not be accessible.  This is because the Java Virtual Machine has a fixed amount of memory available to it, depending on how it is launched.

The typical launch of Autoplot on a 64 bit machine will have 1GB of ram memory.  Some JVM launch methods will only get 256MB of memory, which is easily exhausted.  Some people need to run Autoplot specially so that they will get 4 or 8GB of memory.

For more control over the amount of memory available, launch Autoplot on 64bit Java, which is available here: http://java.com/en/download/.  See also http://autoplot.org/developer.memory
