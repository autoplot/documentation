Purpose: codify standards for the GUI.

Audience: Autoplot developers

# Introduction

It's essential that standards be used in the GUI, and this is to
identify a standard and to outline the ad-hoc rules used so far.

# Menubar

## An ellipses (...) after a menu bar item

An ellipsis (...) after a menu bar item name means that an additional
dialog will be presented to get more information, and this action can be
cancelled. The action may be to bring up a tool (Tools→Events List)
which is used to perform actions. This should not have an ellipsis.

## \&rarr; should be used to identify menu bar items

\&rarr; should be used to identify menu bar items, like
\[menubar\]→Tools→Events List. The \[\] indicates the known position
which the human operator recognizes.
