This describes expert/basic mode, where notice mode removes elements so
users can't break it. Note this was called "novice" mode for a while.

# menu items to remove

## File

  - add plot from. requires test script
  - open opens vaps
  - export data

## Edit

  - Edit dom
  - Inspect Vap file

## Options

  - Rendering Options...
  - Enable Feature should be "advanced/novice"
  - Auto...

## Bookmarks

  - Bookmarks always reset the application.
  - Recent always resets the application.

## Tools

  - Aggregate
  - Decode URL ( this should be a script anyway. )

# Address Bar

  - Start with time range selector.
  - address bar is either time range selector or read-only URI address.

# Tabs

No data, script, or console tabs.

## Style Tab

  - spectrogram renderer should not show middle modes.

# Zoom

  - zooming is restricted to 20% I was referring to the speed of
    zooming, so each step would be 20%. Arguably this should be the same
    for everyone.

# Title Bar

  - Menu bar indicates this as right-aligned menu, so it can show both
    status and allow users to change easily.

## DOM

We're going to add lots of things to the dom, so this needs to be
considered as well. Can we hide parts?
