# documentation

This area contains the mediawiki documentation converted to markdown.  Searches from
the Autoplot website will land here.  At the same time the wiki part of this project 
is used for developing new book-style documentation for Autoplot, and may replace
this target.

The [help](md/help.md) page is most useful for people getting started with Autoplot.
