This doesn't render properly on the help page, where the LaTeX engine is kicking in:
- $(subsec;places=3) three digits are milliseconds.
- $ (subsec;places=3) three digits are milliseconds.
- \$ \(subsec;places=3\) three digits are milliseconds.
- $(subsec; places=3) three digits are milliseconds.

### Wildcard codes

Aggregation URIs will contain from the following wildcard codes:

  - $Y four-digit year
  - $y two-digit year
  - $j three-digit day of year
  - $m two-digit month
  - $b three-letter month (English locale only)
  - $d two-digit day of month
  - $H two-digit hour
  - $M two-digit minute
  - $S two-digit second
  - $(milli) three digit milliseconds since second boundary. (please use
    subsec instead of this)
  - $(micro) three digit microseconds since millisecond boundary.
    (please use subsec instead of this)
  - \$ \(subsec;places=3\) three digits are milliseconds. \$ \(subsec;places=6)
    means the 6 digits are microseconds.  (Remove space--sorry markdown bug)
  - $v version number, decimal sort. \$\(v;alpha\) is for alpha sort, and
    \$ \(v;sep\) for "x.y.z" Note sometimes the filename will contain a V
    before this, and this should be just the number like so: V$v
  - $o orbit number, arguments like \$\(o;id=crres\) make this useful. see
    <https://autoplot.org/developer.orbitTimeSpec#Orbits_in_Time_Ranges>
  - $x ignore, match anything but don't interpret the field.
