This doesn't render properly on the help page, where the LaTeX engine is kicking in:
- $(subsec;places=3) three digits are milliseconds.
- $ (subsec;places=3) three digits are milliseconds.
- \$ \(subsec;places=3\) three digits are milliseconds.
- $(subsec; places=3) three digits are milliseconds.

### Wildcard codes

Aggregation URIs will contain from the following wildcard codes:

  <li> $Y four-digit year
  <li> $y two-digit year
  <li> $j three-digit day of year
  <li> $m two-digit month
  <li> $b three-letter month (English locale only)
  <li> $d two-digit day of month
  <li> $H two-digit hour
  <li> $M two-digit minute
  <li> $S two-digit second
  <li> $(milli) three digit milliseconds since second boundary. (please use
    subsec instead of this)
  <li> $(micro) three digit microseconds since millisecond boundary.
    (please use subsec instead of this)
  <li> $(subsec;places=3) three digits are milliseconds. $(subsec;places=6)
    means the 6 digits are microseconds.  
  <li> $v version number, decimal sort. $(v;alpha) is for alpha sort, and
    $(v;sep) for "x.y.z" Note sometimes the filename will contain a V
    before this, and this should be just the number like so: V$v
  <li> $o orbit number, arguments like $(o;id=crres) make this useful. see
    <https://autoplot.org/developer.orbitTimeSpec#Orbits_in_Time_Ranges>
  <li> $x ignore, match anything but don't interpret the field.
