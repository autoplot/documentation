It would be nice to develop a web page that would give a summary of
usage metrics for Autoplot. This would look at the autoplot.jnlp and
autoplot.jar downloads, and would summarize monthly:

  - Java Platform, to verify which JVMs are used.
  - Autoplot release number, to verify that updates are getting pushed
    out.
  - I don't see how we could identify platform (Windows, Linux, Mac),
    but this would be nice.
  - lat/lon or country/state from IP reverse lookup, to get a sense of
    where it is being used.
