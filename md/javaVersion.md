# Required Java Version

Java 1.7 is required to run Autoplot, but Java 1.8.0u102 is required to
access data from CDAWeb. The problem is the signature used by
NASA/Goddard is not compatible with older versions of Java. While it may
be possible to use an older version of Java to access CDAWeb, it may be
easiest to simply update Java.

To update your Java, see <http://java.com>.

Note Java 1.8 will be required for all users later Spring 2017.
