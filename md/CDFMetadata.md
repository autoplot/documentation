CDFs are a binary file format which have metadata to be associated with data quanities stored in the file.  This metadata 
has a particular schema which Autoplot uses to automatically load units and assign titles.  This page shows
how this metadata is displayed in the GUI.  People using CDF should also be aware of the document 
https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp_guide/vattributes.html which lists all metadata associated with variables.
