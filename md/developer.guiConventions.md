Purpose: define and think about GUI conventions.

Audience: developers, users should provide feedback

1.  those that are adjusted each session
    1.  axis range and titles
    2.  address bar locating data
    3.  status bar
2.  those that are used infrequently, but need to be discoverable
    1.  day of year vs Y-m-d
    2.  change location of autoplot data cache
3.  those that have no cost
    1.  GUI subpanel labels are links
4.  those that provide special function but are intentionally hidden,
    human-to-human or obsolete features.

Also, need to think about global properties vs component properties.

# Additional Guidelines for GUIs

  - textfields should never have tooltips, instead the label should have
    the tooltip.
