Purpose: Describe how custom renderers are created in Jython.

Audience: Developers and Scientists comfortable with Jython code.

# Introduction

Autoplot tries to provide a simple plotting tool for common
applications, such as a stack of line and spectrogram plots, and also
more specific applications such as orbit plots and histograms.

To solve a problem for everyone is always more expensive than trying to
solve a particular problem. Jython scripts have been effective at
allowing strange file types to be read, and to support a specific
science workflow.

Translating data into pixels is the task of the PlotElements, and more
specifically the Renderer object of the Das2 library. Autoplot v2017a\_6
makes this easier to do, by allowing custom Jython code to compose
Renderers. This reduces the impact on Autoplot when rarely used
Renderers clutter the application. For example, a rendering mode called
the "PitchAngleDistribution" mode has always existed so that we could
look at this form of data. This is finally being generalized into the
Polar mode and will be hidden, but this rarely used mode could now be
implemented in Jython, keeping the rest of the application clean.

Also, sometimes a quick annotation needs to be added to a plot, and this
can serve that purpose as well. Note the DasCanvas has had methods for
tying in Jython code in its "addTopDecorator" and "addBottomDecorator"
methods. (A decorator is a computer science term, where an object exists
to add a little functionality to another.)

This also provides a route for Renderers to be created externally, where
one of Autoplot's users can write a renderer, prove its usefulness, and
better argue that it should be part of the application itself.

# Adding Custom Renderers

Here's a Jython script defining a vertical histogram:

```
from org.das2.graph import Renderer
from java.awt.geom import GeneralPath
```
  
```
class HistogramRenderer( Renderer ):
   def autorange( self, ds ):
       xr= extent( ds )
       yr= extent( ds.property( QDataSet.DEPEND_0 ) )
       bds= join(rescaleRange(xr,-0.1,1.1),rescaleRange(yr,-0.1,1.1))
       return bds
```
  
```
   def render( self, g, xaxis, yaxis, monitor=None ):
       xzero= xaxis.transform(0,xaxis.getUnits())
       ds= self.getDataSet()
       if ( ds==None ): return
       yds= ds.property(QDataSet.DEPEND_0)
       ddy= float( ( yds[1]-yds[0] ) / 2 )
       cc= self.getColorControl('color',Color.BLUE)
       cb= cc.darker()
       gp= GeneralPath()
       yd= yaxis.transform(yds[0]-ddy,yaxis.getUnits())
       gp.moveTo( xzero, yd )
       for i in range(ds.length()):
           y= yds.value(i)
           x= ds.value(i)
           xd= xaxis.transform(x,xaxis.getUnits())
           yd= yaxis.transform(y,yaxis.getUnits())
           yd0= yaxis.transform(y-ddy,yaxis.getUnits())
           yd1= yaxis.transform(y+ddy,yaxis.getUnits())
           gp.lineTo( xd, yd0 )
           gp.lineTo( xd, yd1 )
       gp.lineTo( xzero, yd1 )       
       g.setColor( cc )
       g.fill( gp )
       g.setColor( cb )
       g.draw( gp )
```
  
```
# demo code below shows its use.
reset()
ds= append( randomn(5334,10000) , 3+randomn(5335,20000) )
setCanvasSize(724,460)
plot( ds, xpos='3em,70%-3em', ypos='50px,400px', color=Color.BLUE, renderType='scatter', symbolSize=3 )
```
  
```
plot( 1, histogram(ds,50), xpos='70%+2em,100%-2em',  ypos='50px,400px', color=Color.BLUE, 
      ydrawTickLabels=False, renderer= HistogramRenderer() )
```

## Note

  - the plot command has a new "renderer" (not "render") switch. Each
    plot must have its own instance, two plots cannot share an instance.
  - the renderAPI includes a Monitor reference, but this is not used,
    and Renderers should get this job done quickly (\<300ms).
  - the dataset must be retrieved with the self.getDataSet method.
  - self.getColorControl('color',Color.BLUE) gets the color from the
    plotElement's "rendererControl" property, providing a way to control
    it.
  - the example here is a little sloppy with Units, assuming the Axis
    units and data units are the same, and should be updated.
  - the autorange method provides Autoplot with a way to "discover" the
    data with this rendering mode. It is optional, but helps to describe
    what the renderer is intended to do.

## Work to be done

  - icons will be generated automatically, by way of the render method.
  - autoranging multiple Renderers fails.
